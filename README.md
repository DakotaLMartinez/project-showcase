# Project Showcase Application - Client

This is the client-side code for the Project Showcase Application. It is built using React + Vite and communicates with a [Ruby on Rails server-side API](https://github.com/DakotaLMartinez/project-showcase-api) to provide the user with the functionality to add and showcase their projects.

Feel free to visit the [deployed application](https://developer-project-showcase.netlify.app/) if you'd like to create a profile and showcase your own projects. 

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: 
```
git clone git@github.com:DakotaLMartinez/project-showcase.git

```
Navigate your terminal into the project directory:
```
cd project-showcase
```
Install the dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
And start the dev server:
```
yarn dev
```
The application should now be running at: http://localhost:5173.

If you are planning to deploy this on your own, you'll want to replace the url in the `.env.production` file with your own URL.
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-deployed.url
```

You'll also need to clone and setup the [backend API](https://github.com/DakotaLMartinez/project-showcase-api).
